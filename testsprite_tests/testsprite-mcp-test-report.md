# TestSprite AI Testing Report (MCP)

---

## 1️⃣ Document Metadata
- **Project Name:** PetShopRomeoJulieta
- **Version:** 1.0.0
- **Date:** 2025-01-27
- **Prepared by:** TestSprite AI Team

---

## 2️⃣ Executive Summary

This report presents the results of automated testing performed on the PetShopRomeoJulieta application. **All 28 test cases failed** due to server connectivity issues that have since been resolved. The primary issue was that the Vite development server was not serving content correctly, returning empty responses (ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE) which prevented the frontend application from loading.

**Key Findings:**
- Server was running but not serving static files correctly
- Vite cache corruption was identified and resolved
- After clearing cache and restarting with forced re-optimization, server now responds correctly
- All test failures were infrastructure-related, not application logic issues

## 5️⃣ Infrastructure Resolution

**Problem Identified:**
- Vite development server was running but not serving static files correctly
- All requests returned ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE with 0 content length
- Cache corruption in `node_modules/.vite` directory

**Resolution Applied:**
1. Cleared Vite cache: `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules\.vite`
2. Restarted server with forced re-optimization: `npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5173 --force`
3. Verified server response: HTTP 200 with 2931 bytes of content

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Server is running correctly on port 5173
- ✅ Serving content properly (2931 bytes response)
- ✅ Ready for test re-execution

**Recommendation:**
Re-run all test cases now that the server infrastructure issues have been resolved. The application should now be fully accessible for comprehensive testing.

---

## 6️⃣ Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Re-execute all 28 test cases with the fixed server
2. **Priority:** Focus on critical user flows (authentication, pet profiles, appointments)
3. **Secondary:** Test e-commerce and administrative features
4. **Monitoring:** Implement server health checks to prevent similar issues
